## Tiny Search Engine (For CS50)

This repository contains my implementation of a small search engine for my Software Design and Implementation class. In this class I learned how to use the command line and how to program in C. For a while after this project, I actually switched to using C as my default language instead of Java or Python, which was quite overly ambitious/unneccesary for the type of work I was doing (algorithms, Leetcode, etc.). Overall, this project represents my best work in this class and also 
is a good representation of my commenting/documentation abilities.

In order to run this project, you will need to run the crawler, indexer and querier in that order. To run each portion, please navigate to the corresponding directory (named "crawler", "indexer" and "querier" respectively) and reference its README.md for further instructions.
