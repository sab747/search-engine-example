## Tiny Search Engine (For CS50)

This repository contains my implementation of a small search engine for my Software Design and Implementation class. In this class I learned how to use the command line and how to program in C. For a while after this project, I actually switched to using C as my default language instead of Java or Python, which was quite overly ambitious/unneccesary for the type of work I was doing (algorithms, Leetcode, etc.). Overall, this project represents my best work in this class and also 
is a good representation of my commenting/documentation abilities.

In order to run this project navigate to the directory titled "querier" and reference its README.md for further instructions.
